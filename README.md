# Building an E-commerce-website-using-Django-ReactJS

Hi there, I'm building this website using full stack web development with Django 4 as backend and
ReactJS in front end. Along with this I will use a payment gateway to configure our t-shirt selling store.
Full Stack web development is really high in demand, we are bringing 2 of the most popular programming languages together, Python and JavaScript. 
We will start by installing python and a virtual environment.

After that we will install Django and will work on backend. We are using a scalable approach of dividing project into multiple Django apps.
Further we will create API from our backend so that in future you can modify front end without any issues. Django development is very fast and you will quickly realize it.
